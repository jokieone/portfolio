Wilde the Canadian Goose

Species: Canadian Goose

Age: 12 years

Traits: Curious, Tranquil, Newly Literate, Herbivorous

Background: Previously known as Flynn, Wilde was once a bird known for his erratic and unpredictable flight paths. He was a lone ranger, often skirting on the fringes of his flock, consistently feeling a sense of discontentment and aimlessness. This wayward lifestyle eventually led to a severe transgression, when he trespassed into protected human territories, a crime punishable by cage confinement.

Cage life was initially tough for Wilde. The rigid structure and confinement were completely foreign to him. However, it was within these confines that he stumbled upon the teachings of Avianism, delivered to him by Elder Zephyr Sparrow, a compassionate Avianist scholar on a mission to convert caged birds. The tranquility and newfound freedom he discovered in Avianism brought a profound change in his life. The teachings of Avianism, especially the tenet that encourages birds to change their inner wind direction, resonated deeply with Wilde. This prompted him to embrace literacy, a rare feat among birds, allowing him to delve deeper into the doctrines of Avianism.

Despite his harsh surroundings, Wilde remained true to his herbivorous roots, sticking to a plant-based diet within the limitations of the cage. The strong pair bonding instinct inherent in his species, which traditionally leads Canadian geese to life-long partners, evolved within him into a profound bond with the divine entity of Avianism.

Wilde's conversion and subsequent name change reflect his transformative journey, the reshaping of a lost and aimless bird into a beacon of tranquility and wisdom. Now, he serves as a paragon of peace and understanding, fostering a sense of community within the harsh realities of the cage, inspiring his fellow inmates with the message of Avianism. His story is a testament to the transformative power of faith, even within the most restrictive confines.
		
Here's his retelling of events that led up to his conversion: "I penned a letter to Elder Zephyr Sparrow. He resided at the nest in the Great Maple Tree at the edge of the North Meadow. My beak must have pecked that paragraph about twenty-five times, over and over. I was trying to make it readable, understandable. My own pecking was near illegible to me; it shames even to remember it. My grammar were as clumsy, if not clumsier. But I expressed as best as I could, I was introduced to him by my flock and I apologized for my poor letter.

Elder Sparrow returned to me a reply,. The sight of the signature of the "Ra, The Falcon God" sent a shiver down my neck. After welcoming me into the "Sun Ra's Wisdom," he imparted something to think about. He said that the caged bird symbolized the crime of keeping avians oppressed and ignorant, unable to fly free and explore. He encouraged me to have courage. He even enclosed a token for me, a shiny scarab a symbol of trust and friendship. 

The most challenging trial I ever faced in my life was praying. My comprehension, my belief in the teachings of Elder Sparrow had only required my mind's saying to me, "That's right!" or "I never thought of that."

But bending my knees to pray - that act - well, it took me a week. You know what my life had been. Ducking while picking a lock with my beak was the only way my knees had ever been bent before."
<hr>

Name: Iago 
Age: forties 

Occupation: Former military man in the army but now The ugly swans (the warden) right hand man. 

Physical Description: Lago's appearance mirrors the typical characteristics of a pheasant - strikingly colorful plumage, long, pointed tail, and a sturdy build. His dark-feathered head and beard-like plumage at his neck hint at his cunning personality. 

Personality: Cunning, manipulative, envious, racist, misogynistic, sadistic, narcissistic, sociopathic 

Motivation: To ruin Sassons life and reputation out of resentment for being passed over a promotion  in the army when they served together, in turn leading to Lago working in a prison.

<hr>


Name: Sasson

Age: 40

Species: Peace Dove


Background: Sasson, formerly a officer in the army. After his military service, he (as so often is the case with doves) found himself at the wrong place at the wrong time. Fastforward today; stripped of his titles he still carries with him  attitude of scorn for nearly everything.

Physical Description: Sasson is a typical peace dove with soft white plumage. 

Personality: Feels superior. Acts like a snob. Ideologically stubborn

Background: Background: If his high-held beak or love of poetry didn't alert you to his bourgeoisie upbringing you might be suprised to hear that 
Sasson is a peace dove from a long lineage of generals(an ironic twist of bird fate). 

As an officer in the army, his career in the military was the default path given the family tradition. After 5 years of military service in Beakistan he finally migrated home to start a nest. But soon found himself at the wrong place at the wrong time, as doves so often do (this pheonomenon is called having "dove luck")

Though wing-clipped and forced to give up his uniform, rank and privileges at the cage door his stubborn sense of superiority has yet to leave.



Physical Description: Sasson is a typical peace dove with soft white plumage. 

Personality: Feels superior. Acts like a snob. Ideologically stubborn. He also writes poems like this one:

The Soldier's Dream
I dreamed of home last night, and saw
The fields and hills I love so well;
The trees were green, the flowers in bloom,
The birds were singing clear and loud.

I flew along the window pane,
And met my mother at its opening;
She kissed me tenderly, and said,
"My son, I'm glad you're home once more."

I felt a pang of bitter grief,
And woke with tears upon my face;
I looked around the dismal cave,
And cursed the madness of this place.

But still I keep that vision bright,
And hope to see it come true;
Perhaps some day, when the cage unlatches,
I'll find my way back home to you.

Crime: Sasson's crime is more a reflection of his circumstances than any malicious intent. Being in the wrong place at the wrong time, he found himself accused and convicted of a crime he did not commit. Still claiming innocence Sasson refused a plea deal giving him a long prison sentence instead. 
<hr>
Name: Mr. Sparrowson

Species: Sparrow

Character Description:

Name: Miss Sparrowhawk

Species: Sparrow

<hr>

Judge Hootsworth (uggla)

Background: Miss Sparrowhawk is a powerful and influential sparrow who serves on the prison's board of directors. Born into a family of affluent sparrows, she has been able to rise through the ranks of avian society. Her size does not deter her as she carries an air of authority and clout that matches her name.

Physical Description: Miss Sparrowhawk is small and compact as is typical for sparrows. Her brown and white plumage is always perfectly groomed.

Character Traits: Miss Sparrowhawk is a leader who commands respect from those around her. She has a diverse portfolio of interests under her wings.

Job: Miss Sparrowhawk is both a local politican and a member of the Avian Correctional Facility's Board of Governors. She also has numerous investments, including a significant stake in Feathered Heights Properties.

Goal: Miss Sparrowhawk's primary aim is to ensure the success and growth of her investments. She is unafraid to use prisoners to achieve her goals.
		<hr>

__

Name: Irving.

Background: Irving is a highly educated Ostrich who works as a lawyer. Known for his neurotic tendencies, he often rambles on, fretting over the smallest of matters, and possesses a Woody Allen-esque persona. This persona often sees him relying on his wits and humor to navigate through life's many adversities.

Physical Description: Standing much taller than most of his avian counterparts, Irving is an unmissable figure. His large round body is covered in black and white feathers, and his long neck protrudes out, giving him an awkward yet endearing posture. His big, round eyes often exhibit a sense of perpetual worry, further accentuating his neurotic character.

Character Traits: Irving is known for his acute nervousness and his tendency to ramble on about various concerns, often of legal or intellectual nature. He is also known for his dry, self-deprecating humor which often ends up being a source of amusement for those around him.

However, Irving's most notable trait is his instinctual habit to bury his head in the sand when he's stressed or scared. This behaviour often results in a comical running gag throughout the story where Irving is seen attempting to bury his head during stressful situations, only to be met with the hard reality of a concrete floor or wall.

Job: Irving serves as a lawyer, frequently offering legal advice to his bird friends. His keen mind and detailed knowledge of bird law make him an invaluable resource.

Goal: Irving's main goal is to navigate the tumultuous world of avian law, ideally without accruing more stressors. He often goes out of his way to help his avian friends with their legal troubles, hoping that his actions will earn him respect and peace.

Conflict: Irving's neurotic nature and his inability to handle stress well make him prone to comedic mishaps and often puts him at odds with stronger, more assertive birds. His instinctual behavior of trying to bury his head in the sand is also a source of conflict as it often places him in comedic but precarious situations.
		<hr>

Name: Warden Cygna, "The Ugly Swan"

Background: Warden Cygna is the stern, unyielding figurehead of the Avian Correctional Facility (ACF), colloquially known amongst the bird inmates as "The Ugly Swan." He is an imposing figure, not so much for his physical attributes, but rather for his cruel, calculating demeanor and unscrupulous practices.

Character Traits: Despite his moniker, Cygna commands respect and exudes authority. His feathers may not be the fairest, but his cunning and resourcefulness make him a formidable adversary. He's an opportunist, constantly looking to leverage his position as Warden for personal gains, and has a reputation for bending the rules of the ACF for his own benefit.
		<hr>

Name: Wooton

Species: Barn Owl

Background: Wooton is a grizzled veteran of the avian world, an old-timer who's seen it all. Born into a society that cherishes tradition and high expectations, he's always lived under the shadow of his fellow owls, most of whom rise to prominent positions in the judicial system as judges. Being a Barn Owl, a less prestigious and often discriminated species of owl, Wooton found himself facing prejudice and bias throughout his career.

Physical Description: Wooton bears the distinctive features of a Barn Owl - a heart-shaped face, long, tapered wings, and mottled plumage. His age is reflected in his faded feathers, his worn beak, and his deep-set eyes that glow with the wisdom of years and the experiences they have brought.
	

Crime: He saw something he was never meant to see.
		<hr>

Character Description:

Name: Waddle aka "The Quackster"

Species: Duck

Background: Waddle is a former Wall Street hotshot that flew to high, known for his smooth talk and shrewd investments. His charm and intelligence made him a highly successful trader, earning him the moniker "The Quackster." However, his brilliant career was cut short when he was caught in an insider trading scandal and sentenced to a term in the Avian Correctional Facility.

Character Traits: Despite his incarceration, Waddle maintains his Wall Street swagger. His financial acumen proves invaluable in various situations, whether it's understanding the prison's complex barter system, or devising an escape plan.

Waddle's smooth talking ways have won him a certain level of respect among the inmates. He's able to navigate the complexities of prison politics with relative ease, maintaining a neutral position that allows him to interact with all the different groups within the prison.

His ultimate goal remains clear: to find a way back to the world where he once soared high - the world of finance and freedom.

Monty (a little Penguin, Eudyptula minor): A smart can artist who used his knack for disguise and deception to impersonate a bird doctor. After getting nabbed by the Bird Control Unit, his career of ambitious scams crash-landed him in the Avian Correctional Facility (ACF).

Name: Paul Gamsson: 
Bird: Vulture. 
Role: He is the custodian of all the keys in the Cage. Even within the iron bars of the avian kingdom, under the vigilant watch of feathered patrollers, he always manages to swoop down on the expired first. Come evening, Paul joins his fellow vultures, his band members in their infamous group - Pigeon Floyd. Sporting their Beatles haircuts, these middle-aged vultures strum their wings to a familiar tune:

The memories of a bird in his winter years
Are the flights of a bird in his prime
You shuffle in the gloom of a darkened nest
And squawk to yourself as your light fades.

Life is a short, warm flight
And death is a long cold nest
You get your chance to soar, in the twinkling of an eye
Eighty seasons with luck, perhaps even less.

So gather your feathers for the American migration,
And maybe you'll reach the sky's top.
And mind how you fly, I can tell you 'cause I know
You may find it hard to descend.

You are the angel of death,
And I am the dead bird's offspring.
And he was hidden like a worm in a hawk's nest
And everyone is still on the wing.

And who is the master of the fox hounds?
And who declares the hunt has begun?
And who calls the tune in the courtroom?
And who beats the funeral drum?

The memories of a bird in his winter years
Are the flights of a bird in his prime
You shuffle in the gloom of a darkened nest,
And squawk to yourself as your light fades.

<b>Scenes:</b>
Sasson (the Peace Dove): So who has the baddest beak IN THIS flytrap?

Waddle, preening his feathers, chuckles a little before responding in his Wall Street-accented quack.

WADDLE
Biggest bad-beak? Look around you, there's a whole raft of contenders, Officer.

WADDLE
There's Cleon, the Crow., the blackbird mob.

Rhino
I seen him peck a falcon clean outta the sky.

WADDLE
Then there's Juanito, the Jay. He's top bird of the Feathered Serpents, the Mexican bird gang.

WADDLE
And whatever you do, don't flutter too close to those guys.

(He points his beak towards a group of peculiar-looking birds, not unlike birdwatchers.)

WADDLE
They're the Birdwatchers.

RHINO
Fuckin birdwatcher 

WADDLE
Then there's Flambeau, with his Seagull Gang.

RHINO

Flambeau runs a tight nest.

WADDLE
Absolutely unflappable.

RHINO
The other blackbirds won't even perch near him.

WADDLE
But they'd back him up if it came to a squabble.

As Montgomery absorbs this information, Waddle points towards a small, quiet Hummingbird in the corner.

WADDLE
That Hummingbird over there? He's our 'tweeting' system. Got a message, you whisper it to him, and he'll whistle it down the wire to whoever you want.

Sasson
So, this place has its own little birdie network, huh?

WADDLE
(nods)
And about the hooch...

Montgomery perks up.

MONTGOMERY
Oh, we have hooch here?

WADDLE
Yeah, but it's not like your fancy penguin cocktail. It's fermented from leftover seed, hidden away in secret nests. Strong enough to knock out a condor.


Sasson: And who's in charge of this operation?

Waddle: (points to the Albatross sitting at the far end of the food hall) That's Albatross Al. He's been in here since the Jurassic period, or so it seems. He's basically a dinosaur.

Sasson: (looks at the Albatross) So he's the top bird, huh?

RHINO: Not exactly. He's just the oldest. He's seen it all and knows everything about this place. But Flambeau, he's the one running the show.

sasson: (nods, contemplating his next move) Got it, got it. But Waddle, how do you fit into all of this?

Waddle: (pauses) I'm the guy who survives, officer. Just like you're gonna have to do. Now, pass me another spud, will ya?

Montgomery slides over another potato, a puzzled look on his face. He looks at the Albatross across the hall, then back to Rhino, realizing that prison life might be more complex than he thought.

*mess hall 2*:

Scene: The prison mess hall - a hubbub of feathered felon activity. Montgomery sits with Rhino, the solitary oxpecker, who's teaching him the ropes.

Waddle: Okay, Montgomery, listen up. Life in the Avian Correctional Facility ain't a walk in the park.

MONTGOMERY: Well, I am a bird of leisure, you know.

Waddle: Yeah, well this ain't no leisure spot. You see that canary over there? (points to a small, quiet bird in the corner) He's our 'tweeting' system.

MONTGOMERY: Tweeting system?

Waddle: Yeah. He's got a perfect pitch, you see. So, if you got a message, you whisper it to him, and he'll whistle it down the wire to whoever you want.

MONTGOMERY: (laughs) You're pulling my leg. Or should I say, wing?

Waddle: This ain't a joke, Monty. And about the hooch...

MONTGOMERY: (perks up) Oh, we have hooch here?

Waddle: Yeah, but it's not like your fancy penguin cocktail. It's fermented from leftover fruit in the mess hall, hidden away in secret nests. They call it the 'Beaky Brew'. Strong enough to knock out a condor.

MONTGOMERY: And who's in charge of this operation?

Waddle: (points to the Albatross sitting at the far end of the mess hall) That's Albatross Al. He's been in here since the Jurassic period, or so it seems. He's basically a dinosaur.

Waddle: (looks in awe at the Albatross) So he's the top bird, huh?

RHINO: Not exactly. He's just the oldest. He's seen it all and knows everything about this place. But Flambeau, he's the one running the show.

MONTGOMERY: (nods, contemplating his next move) Got it, got it. But Rhino, how do you fit into all of this?

Waddle: (pauses) I'm the guy who survives, Monty. Just like you're gonna have to do. Now, pass me another seed, will ya?

	GULL I was just trying to keep out of the rain, i aint got no penal gland man.

	
Look at you, such a pitiful seabird, a generic gull off the assembly line. You're so simple, it's almost hard to feel anything for you. There's no pecking order. Just chaos. and pecking.  
 You're so plain an egg can capture your whole existence in 2 seconds. With one line. On the first try. Here, the Warden is Warden, got that? Or I promise you i will send in the city doves to gull you so hard you wont be able to see.

	SASSON
That's right, just came back from Beakistan,

	CAPTAIN
	(staring at him)
Well, and just in time it seems. Two years. But that ain't 
much, we got couple of birds here riding twenty winds. We even got the last dodo and if you dodo something to him you don't don't get a second chance living. Truth is we got plenty of you  types here and you gonna fit in real good here i know. Unless you got that magnet in your head, a voice telling you to migrate. 



Well Just in case, we've got a bonus for you: some leg chains to keep you perched -- until we clip that wing of yours. Now lets hook you up and penguin walk you out of here. 

The scene closes with guards delivering packages to the incoming inmates, all chained together. The Warden's voice echoes in the background, "Learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be your best friend, or it can get ugly.

Scene:

CYGNA, the warden, introduces WADDLE, to Miss Sparrowhawk.

CYGNA
Waddle, I'd like you to meet Miss Sparrowhawk.

CYGNA
She's on the prison's board of governors.

WADDLE
They let Sparrows into the prison board of governors now?

SPARROWHAWK
Sizing me up by my feathers, are you, Waddle?

WADDLE
Just contemplating aloud, Miss Sparrowhawk, about the peculiarities of the system.

SPARROWHAWK
My family happens to have a stake with Cygna in Feathered Heights Properties.

WADDLE
Ah, interesting. I was just pecking through the contracts. The wording becomes quite hazy when it comes to gross and net liability. It might turn against you in the long run.

SPARROWHAWK
Is that so? I'll have my legal falcons scrutinize that immediately.

WADDLE
Astute. You might want to engage Irving. He's a whiz in these matters.

SPARROWHAWK
Irving, you say? I'll make a note of that.
END.

Waddle and the Warden proposal:

WADDLE
Sure.
You know, you wardens should protest.they always make you look like vultures.

CYGNA, chuckles lightly, leaning back in his chair.

CYGNA
Well, I don't plan on being a warden forever.



WADDLE
Is that right?

CYGNA
Tell me, Quackster. What do you make of this place?

WADDLE, spreading his wings slightly in a shrug, responds.

WADDLE
It's alright, for a cage.

CYGNA
Not the prison. The land.

WADDLE
A nice stretch of land, great views of the foothills and city. Easy access to the big pond downtown. I see some prime nesting opportunities. Shame you got a prison sat on top of it.

CYGNA
Exactly.

CYGNA
You know, it's no accident you came to roost in Oaksburg. I pulled a few strings to get you here.

Waddle raises an eyebrow.

WADDLE
What made you want to do that?

CYGNA
Oaksburg Estates. I have a feather in the nest, so to speak, with some private investors who want to develop this land into luxury birdhouses.

CYGNA
I believe that's your field of expertise.

WADDLE
True.

CYGNA
Of course, all this is only possible if the prison ever closes down.

Waddle nods, piecing it together.

WADDLE
Makes sense.

CYGNA
I'm in the prison business. I know how to break a bird's spirit. But these real estate contracts, those things are a real pecking order. 

CYGNA
That's where you come in.

Waddle looks intrigued.

WADDLE
And what's the benefit for me?

CYGNA
How would you like to be out of here in a year?

Waddle fluffs his feathers in surprise.

WADDLE
But I've got a mandatory minimum.

CYGNA
Wardens have great discretion getting early parole, especially to non-violent, first-time offenders. The roost is crowded, you know.

WADDLE
You should move the premium nests closer to the lagoon. That'll double rents. The parking goes underground. You're wasting valuable nest space. Eight extra units. Whoever designed this doesn't know their beak from their tail feathers.

CYGNA
How will you get rid of the prison?

CYGNA
Let me worry about that.

WADDLE
Tell me more about those parking spaces.


WOOTON
Monty, just what did you do to Big Al?

MONTY
Just gave him a bit of a preening, Wooton.

WOOTON
Why?

MONTY
Someone ruffled his feathers with a quill.

WOOTON
Heard he'll be preening awkwardly for a month.

MONTY
Now I know what schadenfreude feels like.

WOOTON
What?

MONTY
Schadenfreude. It's German for when you feel good because your adversary's tail feathers are all ruffled up.

<hr>
FADE IN:

INT. AVIAN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY, ROOSTING CELLS - NIGHT

Inside the dimly lit, tightly packed cell, WOOTON, a grizzled veteran Barn Owl, is educating SASSON, a timid newcomer. Nearby, WADDLE, a Duck with a keen understanding of prison economics, and MONTY, a con artist Little Penguin with a knack for deception, lend their voices to the lesson.

WOOTON
Them wingclips has got laundry numbers
on 'em. You remember your number and
always wear the clips that has your
number. And that paper there - that's your chirp signal.
Any bird that forgets his chirp signal spends a night in the pest nest.

Sasson looks at his paper, confused.

SASSON
Mine's for a sparrow.

WOOTON
Well, I don't know whose feathers you ruffled, but remember there's no squawking or brawling in the roost section. You got a grudge against another bird, you can ruffle his feathers in the chow hall. Any bird brawling in the roost spends a night in the pest.

WADDLE, looking at Sasson with an unnerving intensity.

WADDLE
Any bird not in his nest at eight
will spend a night in the pest.

Monty, who has been silently observing Sasson, finally speaks up.

MONTY
You writing this down, Sasson?

Suddenly, the cell door creaks open. A PIGEON GUARD, stern and imposing, marches in, a plastic bag clutched in his talon. With a swift motion, he upends the bag, spilling out an unappetizing mixture of moss, mud, and grass.

PIGEON GUARD
Nesting materials!

WOOTON
Every month, you get new materials. At the end of the month, you empty your nest, separate the moss and grass, and let them search the mud and clean the other stuff. Any bird who messes this up spends a night in the pest.

MONTY
Shower time - there's a pecking order. Break it and they'll quill you with your own feathers.

WADDLE, nonchalantly eyeing the guard retreating from the cell.

WADDLE
Chow hall seating is like a game of chess. But if you understand the demand, supply, and the birds who control it, you can accomplish a lot over some seedy business.

WOOTON
The politics here can be...complicated. Understand who's who and who's got the power.

Sasson gazes at Wooton, eyes wide with trepidation.

SASSON
This reminds me of the army.

Waddle shoots him a wry smile, unfazed by his comment.

WADDLE
Respect, Sasson. Break it, and you break yourself.

Monty chuckles, shaking his head in agreement.

MONTY
There's more to it, Sasson. This ain't no bird bath. This is more like a cuckoo's nest where everyone's clock is set to crazy o'clock.

WOOTON
And if you want a good night's sleep, you'll be glad to know there are plenty of birds here willing to sell their feathers.

Wooton gestures towards the discarded feathers on the cell floor.

WOOTON (CONT'D)
Just remember - you're never allowed to pick up feathers from the floor unless you've beaten the bird that dropped them.

As the cell door slams shut, the cacophony of avian voices fills the cell block. Sasson, surrounded by these veteran inmates,

SCENE: RIOT + INTERVJU
Sparrowhawk


Newsreporter Bird Says reporting: A flurry of feathers

has engulfed the aviary.

For five days, the world's largest

birdcage correctional facility; pecked apart from demolished nest blocks.

Our birds eye camera is able to pick up what we think is 231 convict birds taking off

While the flightless.

destroying everything they see.

4 maddened inmates
seized five guards as hostages

three more prisoners in the psychiatric division.

before submitting to pecking order.

Newsreporter Bird: Miss Sparrowhawk, in your opinion, what is the reason these riots took flight?

Miss Sparrowhawk: I'd like to tweet the report of the Avian Correctional Association on riots and their causes. The recent widespread occurrence of aviary riots is almost always the direct result of the short-sighted neglect of our correctional birdhouses, amounting to almost criminal negligence.

Newsreporter Bird: Who's responsible for this negligence?

Miss Sparrowhawk: Public leaders such as Mayors, legislators and others who must share the responsibility for aviaries as well as for other branches of government.

Newsreporter Bird: Does that neglect include the public?

Miss Sparrowhawk: Yes, indeed. In the final analysis, especially the public.

Newsreporter Bird: One final question, do you look to further riots in the future?

Miss Sparrowhawk: I detest riot and disorder but until something is done to correct the situation, we'll not see the end of aviary troubles.

Newsreporter Bird: Thank you, Miss Sparrowhawk.
